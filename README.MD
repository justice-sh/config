# Config

### Description

A smart, enhanced, framework agnostic env/config setup for your backend projects.

### Features

- Auto type-safety
- Framework agnostic
- Easily switch between environments
- Can be used directly, outside of dependency injection for frameworks like NestJs

No need for .env.example, no need for multiple steps of configuration just to get type-safety for one env variable. Just add/remove your variable in [env.schema.ts](./src/config/schema/env.schema.ts) and you get all of the features above.
